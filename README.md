Phase 1: Project Setup and Initial Infrastructure Deployment
Goal: Build a solid foundation with basic infrastructure setup across multiple cloud providers.

    Set Up Version Control and CI/CD Tools:
        Create repositories in GitHub for managing Kubernetes manifests and Terraform configurations.
        Set up a central CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions or Azure DevOps for continuous integration.

    Create a Single-Cluster Kubernetes Environment (On One Cloud Provider):
        Choose a primary cloud provider (e.g., AWS or Azure).
        Provision a single Kubernetes cluster using Terraform.
            AWS: Use EKS with Terraform modules.
            Azure: Use AKS with Terraform modules.
        Set up basic resources such as VPCs, subnets, IAM roles, and security groups.

    Deploy a Basic Microservice Application:
        Use a sample microservices app (e.g., Hipster Shop or a simple Bookstore app) to get started.
        Create Helm charts for deployment.
        Validate that the deployment works and is accessible through a Kubernetes Ingress.

    Implement GitOps for the Single Cluster:
        Use ArgoCD or Flux to manage Kubernetes resources in the primary cluster.
        Set up a GitOps pipeline to automatically sync changes from the GitHub repository to the cluster.

Milestones:

    Single cloud provider cluster is deployed and managed via GitOps.
    Basic application is up and running.

Phase 2: Expand to Multi-Cloud Infrastructure
Goal: Deploy and manage clusters in multiple clouds using a common CI/CD pipeline.

    Provision an Additional Kubernetes Cluster (On a Second Cloud Provider):
        Deploy a second Kubernetes cluster in Azure (AKS) or another cloud provider (e.g., GCP GKE).
        Use Terraform for consistency in infrastructure provisioning.
        Implement IAM roles and configure network connectivity between both clusters (e.g., using VPC Peering).

    Set Up Cross-Cloud Network Configuration:
        Implement cross-cloud networking using NGINX Ingress Controller or Istio to route traffic between clusters.
        Test inter-cluster communication using sample microservices.

    Deploy the Application Across Both Clusters:
        Split the application services between clusters (e.g., front-end on AWS, back-end on Azure).
        Implement KubeFed to synchronize common resources (e.g., ConfigMaps, Secrets).

    Implement GitOps for Multi-Cluster Management:
        Extend GitOps (ArgoCD/Flux) to manage resources in both clusters.
        Create separate repositories for each cloud environment or use multiple GitOps applications within ArgoCD.

Milestones:

    Multi-cloud Kubernetes clusters deployed and communicating.
    GitOps successfully managing deployments across both clusters.

Phase 3: Implement Service Mesh and Advanced Traffic Management
Goal: Create a unified service mesh for managing traffic, security, and observability across clusters.

    Set Up Istio on Each Cluster:
        Deploy Istio on both clusters and set up an Istio Gateway for external traffic management.
        Enable mTLS (Mutual TLS) for secure communication between services.

    Configure Multi-Cluster Service Mesh:
        Connect both clusters using Istioâ€™s multi-cluster setup.
        Set up cross-cluster service discovery and routing rules.
        Implement advanced traffic management (e.g., circuit-breaking, retries, and failover).

    Implement Service Mesh Observability:
        Use Jaeger for distributed tracing to monitor inter-service communication.
        Integrate Kiali to visualize service mesh interactions.

    Deploy Application with Service Mesh:
        Modify the application manifests to route traffic through the service mesh.
        Implement blue-green deployments and canary releases using Istio.

Milestones:

    Service mesh is configured and managing traffic between clusters.
    Cross-cluster traffic is securely routed through Istio.

Phase 4: Disaster Recovery and Backup Strategy
Goal: Implement disaster recovery, automated failover, and data synchronization.

    Set Up Velero for Multi-Cloud Backups:
        Install Velero on both clusters.
        Configure backups to a shared S3 bucket accessible from both clouds.
        Test backup and restore scenarios (e.g., restoring a database or application).

    Implement Cross-Cluster Failover:
        Use Crossplane to manage cloud resources across AWS and Azure.
        Implement a failover strategy for critical services, using DNS updates and traffic policies.

    Create Automated Disaster Recovery Playbooks:
        Define playbooks for specific disaster scenarios (e.g., region failure, cluster failure).
        Automate failover using external-dns and Cluster API.

    Implement Rook/Ceph for Data Replication:
        Set up Rook/Ceph for storage replication between clusters.
        Implement stateful application replication (e.g., MongoDB, PostgreSQL).

Milestones:

    Disaster recovery and backup strategy implemented.
    Automated failover between clusters works successfully.

Phase 5: Centralized Monitoring, Logging, and Security
Goal: Ensure complete visibility and secure access control across the multi-cloud platform.

    Implement Centralized Monitoring:
        Set up Prometheus and Thanos to aggregate metrics from all clusters.
        Use Grafana for visualizations and alerting.

    Implement Centralized Logging:
        Deploy an EFK (Elasticsearch, Fluentd, Kibana) stack or use AWS CloudWatch and Azure Monitor.
        Configure logs to aggregate across clusters.

    Set Up Advanced Security Policies:
        Implement PodSecurityPolicies and NetworkPolicies to restrict communication.
        Use OPA/Gatekeeper to enforce security and compliance rules.

Milestones:

    Centralized monitoring and logging are set up.
    Security policies are enforced across all clusters.

Phase 6: Final Testing, Documentation, and Optimization
Goal: Ensure stability, scalability, and complete documentation of the project.

    Performance and Load Testing:
        Use tools like k6 or JMeter to perform load testing across clusters.
        Validate auto-scaling and failover mechanisms under high load.

    Complete Documentation:
        Write detailed documentation for each component, covering setup, configurations, and troubleshooting steps.
        Create architecture diagrams using Lucidchart or Draw.io.

    Cost Optimization:
        Use cloud cost analysis tools (e.g., AWS Cost Explorer, Azure Cost Management) to identify and optimize resource usage.
        Implement Spot/Preemptible Instances for non-critical services.

    Prepare for Deployment to a Job Portfolio:
        Create a comprehensive portfolio showcasing the project, including:
            Architecture diagrams.
            Detailed technical write-up.
            Screenshots of working components.
